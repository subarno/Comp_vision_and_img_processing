# Task Descriptions

## Task 1 : writing a program that binarizes an image. It should meet the following requirements:
1.1 It performs the global adaptive thresholding. The input parameters are: input image and value ϵ.
1.2 It performs the local adaptive thresholding. The input parameters are: input image and the dimension of the local neighbourhood Ww × Hw.

## Task 2 : writing a program that meets the following requirements:
2.1 It computes a histogram of oriented gradients for a given image. The input parameters are: grayscale image, number of chaincode directions, and grid dimension.
2.1 It estimates the similarity between two input images by calculating the cosine similarity between their histograms of oriented gradients.

## Task 3 : writing a program that meets the following requirements:
3.1 It reads an object represented in imageA and detects its occurrences in imageB, by applying the sliding window technique. The input parameters are: two grayscale images, number of chaincode directions, grid dimension, sliding window dimension, sliding window steps along the x- and y-axis, etc.

## Task 4 : writing a program that meets the following requirements:
4.1  A program that implements the graph-based image segmentation using the tree-based union and find algorithm.

## Task 5 : writing a program that meets the following requirements:
5.1  A program for dynamic signature verification based on the (adapted) Levenshtein distance algorithm
